# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Movies2See

Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: _JiaxinLi_

This repo contains starter files:  

- `assignment1.py` is the file you must write your assignment code in.
- `movies.csv` is a data file for you to use.  
- `movies_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used in your program... This is here as a backup to copy the data from if you need it again.
- `README.md` is the file you're reading. You must edit this to answer the questions below.

Edit this README file, replacing the instructions (including this paragraph) with your own assignment details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace
the `answer...` parts).

1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?

    I wrote this code from start to finish in about ten days, with countless debugging sessions, and a couple of those days were spent working on assignments for other subjects so it seems to have taken a long time. In fact, it did take me a lot of time!

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

    When completing assignment2, I plan to allocate the assignment time more reasonably, set up a clear plan to complete the daily progress, and work with my classmates to make regular feedback on each other's code, and ask my classmates or the teacher if there are any problems I don't  understand. Reduce the appearance of repetitive code, so that my code looks more concise and clear!
